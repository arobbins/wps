            <h1 class="about-heading">Hey there. My name's Andrew and I'm the creator of ShopWP. I'm passionate about helping small businesses like yours.</h1>
            <div class="l-contain-s">
                <p>I've been a professional Web Developer for over 10 years. I have a passion for open-source which is why I've always liked working with WordPress. I've built many custom plugins and themes over the years.</p>
                <p><b style="color:#f4bc41">I created ShopWP in 2016</b>&mdash;back then it was called <s>WP Shopify</s>. Seems like ages ago!</p>
                <p>It was a simple idea for a client project that slowly turned into something more.</p> 
                <p>Fast forward 7 years, and <b style="color:#f4bc41">I now work on it full-time.</b> ðŸ’ª</p>
                <p>I love working on ShopWP because I get to help fellow entrepreneurs pursue their dreams. I know how much starting a business has improved my life, and I'm grateful to have the opportunity to help others do the same.</p>
                <p>I currently live in Austin, TX with my beautiful wife and son. We have two cats (Kirby and August), and our new favorite place to visit is Wengen, Switzerland!</p>
                <p>I look forward to working with you soon.</p>
                <p>Be great today!<br><small>- Andrew, Creator of ShopWP</small></p>
