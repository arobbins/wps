        <small>Posted August 23rd, 2022</small>
        <h2>ShopWP 6.0 is here!<br><br>
        Available today is a monumental update to the plugin syncing. The entire process has been re-built from the ground up.<br><br>Some of the most notable changes are: auto syncing, native WordPress taxonomies, image sync and much more. <br><br>Let's take a closer look at each one.</h2>
    </div>

   <div class="release-marquee-body l-contain">
    
        <div class="release-content-section">
            <div class="l-contain">
                <h3>UI changes ðŸ‘€</h3>
                <p>One giant change is the overall syncing UI. As you can see in the below screenshot, there is now much more information visible while the sync is running.</p>

                <p>The big grey box in the middle is called the Sync Log. It will show you a detailed breakdown of what's actually happening during the sync. You can choose to show all info, or just warnings / errors by clicking the visibility icon as well.</p>

                <p>Once the sync is finished, you'll have the option of downloading the sync log. This can really help you debug any issues that may come up. The messages found inside this sync log are only related to the syncing and nothing else.</p>

                <p>Below the grey box is information regarding which data is actually being synced. My hope is that this helps remove any ambiguity during the sync.</p>
                
                <p></p>

            <div class="release-content-image">
                <img src="/wp-content/themes/shopwp/assets/imgs/new-release-1.png" />
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="release-content-section">
            <div class="l-contain">
                <h3>Auto syncing ðŸ•—</h3>
                <p>This is probably my favorite new feature.</p>
                <p>Prior to version 6.0, auto syncing was handled by webhooks. This worked (usually), but had issues and limitations on some web hosts. In version 6.0, auto syncing has been re-built and is now a standard WordPress cron job.</p>
                <p>You'll be able to set the cron interval (how often you want the sync to run), as well as the sync query. As long as the admin pages are loaded frequently, the cron will continue to run.</p>
                <p>Behind the scenes, ShopWP is using <a href="https://shopify.dev/api/usage/bulk-operations/queries" target="_blank">Shopify Bulk Operations</a>. This leverages the Shopify servers to do all the heavy work of requesting data. It essentially allows ShopWP to perform very large data queries via GraphQL without being limited by pagination.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="release-content-image">
                <img src="/wp-content/themes/shopwp/assets/imgs/syncing-screenshot-3.png" />

            <div class="l-contain">
                <h3>Upgraded custom post types ðŸ“–</h3>
                <p>The ShopWP custom post types for products and collections have been massively upgraded. Let's take a look!</p>
                <p>Within the custom post type UI, you'll now see your Shopify taxonomies reflected as native WordPress taxonomies! This has been one of the most requested features, and will help tremendously for integrating with other plugins like Yoast, ACF, page builders, etc.</p>
                <p>As you can see in the screenshots below, Your Shopify vendors, tags, collections, and product types are transferred as standard WordPress taxonomies. If you choose to delete the data from WordPress, these taxonomies will also be removed. No mess left behind.</p>

                <h3>Image syncing ðŸŒ…</h3>
                <p>Your Shopify images will now sync natively into WordPress!</p>
                <p>You'll have the option of not syncing images, only syncing featured images, or all images directly into the media library.</p>
                <p>This will help you use the WordPress functions like <b>get_the_post_thumbnail()</b> and <b>the_post_thumbnail()</b> within custom loops.</p>
                <p>Choosing to sync images will slow the sync down, but you can just keep it running for as long as it takes to finish. You can also choose to sync everything else first, and then sync images by themselves if you wish.</p>

            <div class="l-contain">
                <h3>Post meta data ðŸ’¾</h3>
                <p>You now have the option of syncing much of your product and collection data into post meta. This feature is turned off by default, but you can enable it within the plugin settings.</p>
                <p>Effortlessly integrate your products and collections with other plugins like Elementor, Yoast, or ACF. The only limitation is your imagination when building out custom themes and product layouts.</p>

                <h3>Better syncing controls ðŸŽ›</h3>
                <p>Many of the existing syncing settings have been revamped and greatly improved.</p>
                <p>One really cool addition is the "Products sync query" setting. This allows you to specify with powerful granularity which products to sync.</p>
                <p>The plugin uses the <a href="https://shopify.dev/api/usage/search-syntax" target="_blank">Shopify search syntax</a> for this, and empowers users to adjust this however they wish. Sync all products with the asterisks (*), or only products from a certain tag: (tag:books).</p>
                <p>Another new addition to the syncing settings are the data selections. This allows you to <i>sync only the data you really want</i> and nothing more.</p>
